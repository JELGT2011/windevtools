Small tools to make ASP.NET development easier.

These are some little pieces I've accumulated that make ASP.NET development less painful.

* Privilege Escalation.cmd - easily get to the windows services desktop. Useful for deleting files you can't even delete as Administrator.
* iisreset.reg - Registry AppCompat flag to make sure when you run iisreset.exe you get prompted for elevation.
